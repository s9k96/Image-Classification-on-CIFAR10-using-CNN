## PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
- CIFAR-10 is a dataset that consists of several images divided into the following 10 classes:
    - Airplanes
    - Cars
    - Birds
    - Cats
    - Deers
    - Dogs
    - Frogs
    - Horses
    - Ships
    - Trucks
- Dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images, ie 6000 images per class. 
- We need to design a model to predict the label of these images correctly.
